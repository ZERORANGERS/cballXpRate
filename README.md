# CballXpRate
This plugin calculates Slayer and Ranged XP gained per cannonball used and displays the values in an overlay.

It provides a useful set of information for those looking to track how their gear / levels / mobs they are fighting affect the xp they are receiving per cannonball used. This is especially important for someone looking to achieve an untrimmed slayer cape.
